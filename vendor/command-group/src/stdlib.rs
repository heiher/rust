/// Extensions for [`Command`](std::process::Command) adding support for process groups.
pub trait CommandGroup {
	/// Executes the command as a child process group, returning a handle to it.
	///
	/// By default, stdin, stdout and stderr are inherited from the parent.
	///
	/// On Windows, this creates a job object instead of a POSIX process group.
	///
	/// # Examples
	///
	/// Basic usage:
	///
	/// ```no_run
	/// use std::process::Command;
	/// use command_group::CommandGroup;
	///
	/// Command::new("ls")
	///         .group_spawn()
	///         .expect("ls command failed to start");
	/// ```
	fn group_spawn(&mut self) -> Result<GroupChild> {
		self.group().spawn()
	}

	/// Converts the implementor into a [`CommandGroupBuilder`](crate::CommandGroupBuilder), which can be used to
	/// set flags that are not available on the `Command` type.
	fn group(&mut self) -> CommandGroupBuilder<std::process::Command>;

	/// Executes the command as a child process group, waiting for it to finish and
	/// collecting all of its output.
	///
	/// By default, stdout and stderr are captured (and used to provide the
	/// resulting output). Stdin is not inherited from the parent and any
	/// attempt by the child process to read from the stdin stream will result
	/// in the stream immediately closing.
	///
	/// On Windows, this creates a job object instead of a POSIX process group.
	///
	/// # Examples
	///
	/// ```should_panic
	/// use std::process::Command;
	/// use std::io::{self, Write};
	/// use command_group::CommandGroup;
	///
	/// let output = Command::new("/bin/cat")
	///                      .arg("file.txt")
	///                      .group_output()
	///                      .expect("failed to execute process");
	///
	/// println!("status: {}", output.status);
	/// io::stdout().write_all(&output.stdout).unwrap();
	/// io::stderr().write_all(&output.stderr).unwrap();
	///
	/// assert!(output.status.success());
	/// ```

		self.group_spawn()
